Simple webpage presentation application

##What is it?

In Mac OS X 10.9, I discovered that if spaces are linked, you are unable to present a webpage fullscreen on a secondary display without losing control of your primary display. This was problematic, and so I put together a simple Python application to fix the problem.

Since projectors are sometimes put into widescreen mode, this also solves the problem of how to rescale a webpage so that it can be viewed correctly. A widescreen mode simply adds a CSS transform to the body of the page.

##Why is it called Nest?

The original situation I used it in was to present a webpage for my mobile app, CarrierPigeon. So I continued with the bird theme and called it Nest.
